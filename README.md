# Raspberry-PI-Server
Making my own Server where i upload files and pictures for Studies and have them organized by categories.
With this little project i wanted to dip my toes into Java Spring Boot which i will learn in University.

Overall i would say Spring Boot is A LOT but i think with this project i learned a little bit more about it. Bye :)
